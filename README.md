# EEG-Based-Emotion-Recognition
# üß† EEG-Based Emotion Recognition using Deep Learning

This project focuses on recognizing emotional or perceptual states from EEG signals recorded while participants listened to music. Using the **Stanford NMED-RP EEG dataset**, we implemented a full EEG data pipeline including preprocessing, segmentation, deep learning model training, and performance evaluation.

## üìÅ Dataset

**Source:** Stanford Naturalistic Music EEG Dataset ‚Äì Rhythm Pilot (NMED-RP)  
- 5 participants  
- 128-channel dense-array EEG (EGI system)  
- Sampling Rate: 1000 Hz  
- 30-second music excerpts from 4 rhythmic categories  
- Behavioral ratings: enjoyment, rhythmic complexity, beat perception

## üîß Methodology

1. **EEG Segmentation**  
   - Trigger-based trial extraction  
   - Removal of noisy segments  
   - Selection of top 64 informative channels

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Bandpass Filtering (1‚Äì40 Hz)  
   - Artifact removal using ICA (eye & muscle)  
   - Amplitude thresholding for noise control

3. **Deep Learning Models**  
   We evaluated multiple architectures:
   - CNN + LSTM
   - EEGNet
   - EEGFormer (Transformer-based)
   - DeepConvNet
   - ShallowConvNet
   - Graph Neural Network (GNN)

4. **Evaluation & Comparison**  
   - Accuracy used as the primary metric  
   - CNN+LSTM achieved the highest accuracy (~90%)  
   - Results compared against existing studies (e.g., Appaji et al., 2018)
